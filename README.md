# Porcupine

Set porcupine as your default web browser. When you click a link, instead of opening it, it just copies the URL to your clipboard and notifies you about this. This way you'll never accidentally open a link you don't want to, and you can easily choose which browser to paste it into.

Dependencies: `sudo apt install python3-gi python3-pyperclip`
