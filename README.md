# Porcupine

Set porcupine as your default web browser. When you click a link, instead of opening it, it just copies the URL to your clipboard and notifies you about this. This way you'll never accidentally open a link you don't want to, and you can easily choose which browser to paste it into.

Dependencies: `sudo apt install python3-gi python3-pyperclip python3-pyqt5`

Porcupine isn't packaged yet, but you can install it with `sudo ./install.sh`. If you're running Subgraph OS, use `./install.sh --subgraph` instead.
