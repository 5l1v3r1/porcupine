# Porcupine

Set porcupine as your default web browser. When you click a link, porcupine will copy the URL to your clipboard and notify you about this. Or it can run a command of your choice. This way you'll never accidentally open a link you don't want to, and you can easily choose which browser to load it in.

To build from source, see [these instructions](BUILD.md).

After installing, you can set porcupine as your default browser in Linux by typing: `xdg-settings set default-web-browser porcupine.desktop`
